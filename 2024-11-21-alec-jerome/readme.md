# Alec Jerome Film + Video Game Workshop
Join artist and technologist Alec Jerome for a hands-on workshop on creating films and video games using AI and 3D tools. Participants will learn how to generate 3D models and integrate them into Blender, an open-source 3D creation suite for modeling, animation, and rendering. The workshop will cover exporting scenes to Unreal Engine, a powerful game development platform widely used for real-time 3D production, including motion tracking with Adobe After Effects for realistic animations, AI-driven sound generation, and previsualization using tools such as DALL·E by OpenAI. The session will also introduce Unreal Engine’s MetaHuman Creator, a cloud-based app developed by Epic Games for creating digital human avatars. Bring a laptop with the latest versions of Unreal Engine and Blender. Post-event support will be available via Discord.
